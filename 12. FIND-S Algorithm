Aim:
To implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis using training data from a CSV file.

---

Algorithm:

1. Load the training dataset from a CSV file using pandas.
2. Identify the first positive example in the dataset.
3. Initialize the hypothesis with the first positive example.
4. For each subsequent positive example:
   - Compare each attribute with the current hypothesis.
   - If the attribute differs, replace it with '?', else keep it the same.
5. Return the final hypothesis as the most specific hypothesis.

---

Python Program:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("Ex1_data.csv")
concepts = np.array(data.iloc[:, :-1])
target = np.array(data.iloc[:, -1])

# FIND-S Algorithm
def find_s(concepts, target):
    for i, val in enumerate(target):
        if val.lower() == "yes":
            hypothesis = concepts[i].copy()
            break

    for i, val in enumerate(concepts):
        if target[i].lower() == "yes":
            for j in range(len(hypothesis)):
                if val[j] != hypothesis[j]:
                    hypothesis[j] = '?'
    return hypothesis

final_hypothesis = find_s(concepts, target)
print("Final Specific Hypothesis:", final_hypothesis)

---

Sample CSV (Ex1_data.csv):

Sky,Temp,Humidity,Wind,Water,Forecast,EnjoySport
sunny,warm,normal,strong,warm,same,yes
sunny,warm,high,strong,warm,same,yes
rainy,cold,high,strong,warm,change,no
sunny,warm,high,strong,cool,change,yes

---

Expected Output
Final Specific Hypothesis: ['sunny' 'warm' '?' 'strong' '?' '?']

-----

Result
Thus, the FIND-S algorithm has been successfully implemented and executed.
